1. Write a program that uses nested for loops to produce the following output:

&
&&
&&&
&&&&
&&&&&
&&&&&&

2. Write a program that prompts the user for the length, width, and height of a 
rectangular box. Have the program calculate and display the surface area and 
volume of the box. Continue to prompt the user for a set of new box dimensions 
and output the calculated surface area and volume until a zero or negative 
dimension is entered.

3. Write a program that determines if a user entered integer is a prime number. 
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that can be divided evenly only by 
1 or itself. Examples of prime numbers are: 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13. (Hint: Use a 
while loop and an if statement incorporating the modulo operator.) The output 
should look like the following with an explanation if it not a prime:

Enter an integer to be tested if a prime number: 9
The number is not prime because it is divisible by 3

Enter an integer to be tested if a prime number: 5683
The number is a prime.

4. Write a program that reads input until encountering the # character and then 
reports the number of spaces read, the number of new line characters read, 
and the number of all other characters read.

5. Write an encryption program that reads in a single sentence up to the period. 
The program outputs the modified sentence with all of the spaces removed and 
replaces each of the vowels with the letter 'Z'.
